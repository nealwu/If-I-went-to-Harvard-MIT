SOON:
* Do Bootstrap tutorial: http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/tutorial.php
* Make the entry box expand when you type a long post.git 
* Make the table nicer. The text is taking up too much of the space.
* Change the background color. Ugh.

SOONISH:
* make the add box a search box as well
* Make the whole user thing work.

LATER:
* Find some REALLY good first couple posts.
